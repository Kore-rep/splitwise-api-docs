    Returns a list of all categories Splitwise allows for expenses. There are parent categories that represent groups of categories with subcategories for more specific categorization.
    When creating expenses, you must use a subcategory, not a parent category.
    If you intend for an expense to be represented by the parent category and nothing more specific, please use the "Other" subcategory.
