  summary: Get notifications
  description: |
    Return a list of recent activity on the users account with the most recent items first.
    `content` will be suitable for display in HTML and uses only the `<strong>`, `<strike>`, `<small>`,
    `<br>` and `<font color="#FFEE44">` tags.

    The `type` value indicates what the notification is about. Notification types may be added in the future
    without warning. Below is an incomplete list of notification types.

    | Type | Meaning |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | 0    | Expense added |
    | 1    | Expense updated |
    | 2	   | Expense deleted |
    | 3	   | Comment added |
    | 4	   | Added to group |
    | 5	   | Removed from group |
    | 6	   | Group deleted |
    | 7	   | Group settings changed |
    | 8	   | Added as friend |
    | 9	   | Removed as friend |
    | 10	 | News (a URL should be included) |
    | 11	 | Debt simplification |
    | 12	 | Group undeleted |
    | 13	 | Expense undeleted |
    | 14	 | Group currency conversion |
    | 15	 | Friend currency conversion |

    **Note**: While all parameters are optional, the server sets arbitrary (but large) limits
    on the number of notifications returned if you set a very old `updated_after` value or `limit` of `0` for a
    user with many notifications.
