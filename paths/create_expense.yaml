  summary: Create an expense
  description: |
    Creates an expense. You may either split an expense equally (only with `group_id` provided),
    or supply a list of shares.

    When splitting equally, the authenticated user is assumed to be the payer.

    When providing a list of shares, each share must include `paid_share` and `owed_share`, and must be identified by one of the following:
    - `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name`
    - `user_id`

    **Note**: 200 OK does not indicate a successful response. The operation was successful only if `errors` is empty.
