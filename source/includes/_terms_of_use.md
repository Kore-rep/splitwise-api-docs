# Terms of Use

### The general idea

Splitwise provides you with access to our API so that you can develop cool new stuff. We will help support you as best we can, but we can't guarantee the API's reliability (no warranty), and we may need to change or switch things at our discretion, including these Terms of Use themselves. We use these APIs for developing our own apps too, and if there's an unforeseen issue that requires us to change the API in order to keep our own apps running, then that change will likely take precedence over any third-party tools.

### How you use stuff

We're excited to see what you build with our API! You can charge for your tools (or not), show ads (or not), and do pretty much anything else you'd like to do. On the other hand, please do NOT do anything deceptive or manipulative with the Splitwise API, do NOT steal users' data without their consent, and in general do NOT do anything that would violate the spirit of fairness and transparency. We reserve the right to revoke your API key if we think you are doing something malicious, or something bad for our business.

We may also need to throttle your API calls if you send us large amounts of traffic, or if your API calls are causing other issues, but if so, we will get in touch and explain what's going on.

### Data use

Data from the Splitwise API should be stored locally (i.e. on the user's client, not on your app's servers). You agree not to use a user's contact info or expense tracking data for unrelated purposes (e.g. you shouldn't spam a person's contacts list). Splitwise takes user privacy very seriously, and violating these conditions may result in termination of your API access at any time.
